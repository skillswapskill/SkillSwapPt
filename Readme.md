Project Name: SkillSwap – Decentralized Peer Learning Platform
Concept:
A platform where users can exchange skills without money – using a skill credit system. For example, someone can teach “JavaScript for 1 hour” and earn 1 skill credit, which they can use to learn “Guitar” or “Public Speaking” from someone else.

Key Features:
🔐 Authentication & User Profiles
JWT-based auth

Skill tags in profile (e.g., #Python, #Photography)

Availability calendar

🧠 Skill Credit System
Users earn credits by teaching and spend them to learn.

Ledger system to track earnings and spending

🧭 Matching Algorithm
Smart matching based on skill needs, availability, and location (if in-person is chosen)

📹 Integrated Video Call / Chat
Use WebRTC or external APIs like Jitsi or Daily

Real-time chat with message history using Socket.IO or WebSockets

🗓️ Booking System
Users can schedule sessions and get reminders

🛡️ Reputation System
Ratings, reviews, and skill endorsements

Tech Stack:
Frontend:
Vite + React

Tailwind CSS for styling

Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions

Backend:
Node.js + Express

MongoDB with Mongoose

Socket.IO for real-time chat

JWT + bcrypt for authentication

Extra Tools:
PostgreSQL (for transactions or history if you want RDBMS)

Redis for caching and availability optimization

WebRTC or Daily/Jitsi API for video calls

Unique Factor:
Unlike common learning platforms, this is non-monetary and decentralized, relying on value exchange through skills — a concept that can help users in developing regions or students who can't afford paid courses.
